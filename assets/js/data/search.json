    "snippet": "This post is to enable Page Views on the Chirpy theme based blog that you just built. This requires technical knowledge and it’s recommended to keep the google_analytics.pv.* empty unless you have a good reason. If your website has low traffic, the page views count would discourage you to write more blogs. With that said, let’s start with the setup.Set up Google AnalyticsCreate GA account and propertyFirst, you need to set up your account on Google analytics. While you create your account, you must create your first Property as well.  Head to https://analytics.google.com/ and click on Start Measuring  Enter your desired Account Name and choose the desired checkboxes  Enter your desired Property Name. This is the name of the tracker project that appears on your Google Analytics dashboard  Enter the required information About your business  Hit Create and accept any license popup to set up your Google Analytics account and create your propertyCreate Data StreamWith your property created, you now need to set up Data Stream to track your blog traffic. After you signup, the prompt should automatically take you to create your first Data Stream. If not, follow these steps:  Go to Admin on the left column  Select the desired property from the drop-down on the second column  Click on Data Streams  Add a stream and click on Web  Enter your blog’s URLIt should look like this:Now, click on the new data stream and grab the Measurement ID. It should look something like G-V6XXXXXXXX. Copy this to your _config.yml filegoogle_analytics:  id: &#39;G-V6XXXXXXX&#39;   # fill in your Google Analytics ID  # Google Analytics pageviews report settings  pv:    proxy_endpoint:   # fill in the Google Analytics superProxy endpoint of Google App Engine    cache_path:       # the local PV cache data, friendly to visitors from GFW regionWhen you push these changes to your blog, you should start seeing the traffic on your Google Analytics. Play around with the Google Analytics dashboard to get familiar with the options available as it takes like 5 mins to pick up your changes. You should now be able to monitor your traffic in real time.Setup Page ViewsThere is a detailed tutorial available to set up Google Analytics superProxy. But, if you are interested to just quickly get your Chirpy-based blog display page views, follow along. These steps were tested on a Linux machine. If you are running Windows, you can use the Git bash terminal to run Unix-like commands.Setup Google App Engine      Visit https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine        Click on Create Application        Click on Create Project        Enter the name and choose the data center close to you        Select Python language and Standard environment        Enable billing account. Yeah, you have to link your credit card. But, you won’t be billed unless you exceed your free quota. For a simple blog, the free quota is more than sufficient.        Go to your App Engine dashboard on your browser and select API &amp;amp; Services from the left navigation menu        Click on Enable APIs and Services button on the top        Enable the following APIs: Google Analytics API        On the left, Click on OAuth Consent Screen and accept Configure Consent Screen. Select External since your blog is probably hosted for the public. Click on Publish under Publishing Status        Click on Credentials on the left and create a new OAuth Client IDs credential. Make sure to add an entry under Authorized redirect URIs that matches: https://&amp;lt;project-id&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;region&amp;gt;.r.appspot.com/admin/auth        Note down the Your Client ID and Your Client Secret. You’ll need this in the next section.        Download and install the cloud SDK for your platform: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart        Run the following commands:    [root@bc96abf71ef8 /]# gcloud init~snip~Go to the following link in your browser:    https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?response_type=code&amp;amp;client_id=XYZ.apps.googleusercontent.com&amp;amp;redirect_uri=ABCDEFGEnter verification code: &amp;lt;VERIFICATION CODE THAT YOU GET AFTER YOU VISIT AND AUTHENTICATE FROM THE ABOVE LINK&amp;gt;You are logged in as: [blah_blah@gmail.com].Pick cloud project to use:[1] chirpy-test-300716[2] Create a new projectPlease enter numeric choice or text value (must exactly match listitem): 1[root@bc96abf71ef8 /]# gcloud info# Your selected project info should be displayed here      Setup Google Analytics superProxy      Clone the Google Analytics superProxy project on Github: https://github.com/googleanalytics/google-analytics-super-proxy to your local.    Remove the first 2 lines in the src/app.yaml file:    - application: your-project-id- version: 1            In src/config.py, add the OAUTH_CLIENT_ID and OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET that you gathered from your App Engine Dashboard.        Enter any random key for XSRF_KEY, your config.py should look similar to this     #!/usr/bin/python2.7 __author__ = &#39;pete.frisella@gmail.com (Pete Frisella)&#39; # OAuth 2.0 Client Settings AUTH_CONFIG = {   &#39;OAUTH_CLIENT_ID&#39;: &#39;YOUR_CLIENT_ID&#39;,   &#39;OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET&#39;: &#39;YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET&#39;,   &#39;OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI&#39;: &#39;%s%s&#39; % (     &#39;https://chirpy-test-XXXXXX.ue.r.appspot.com&#39;,     &#39;/admin/auth&#39;   ) } # XSRF Settings XSRF_KEY = &#39;OnceUponATimeThereLivedALegend&#39;        Tip: You can configure a custom domain instead of https://PROJECT_ID.REGION_ID.r.appspot.com. But, for the sake of keeping it simple, we will be using the Google provided default URL.        From inside the src/ directory, deploy the app     [root@bc96abf71ef8 src]# gcloud app deploy Services to deploy: descriptor:      [/tmp/google-analytics-super-proxy/src/app.yaml] source:          [/tmp/google-analytics-super-proxy/src] target project:  [chirpy-test-XXXX] target service:  [default] target version:  [VESRION_NUM] target url:      [https://chirpy-test-XXXX.ue.r.appspot.com] Do you want to continue (Y/n)?

Add a /admin to the end of the URL.        Click on Authorize Users and make sure to add yourself as a managed user.    If you get any errors, please Google it. The errors are self-explanatory and should be easy to fix.If everything went good, you’ll get this screen:Create Google Analytics QueryHead to https://PROJECT_ID.REGION_ID.r.appspot.com/admin and create a query after verifying the account. GA Core Reporting API query request can be created in Query Explorer.The query parameters are as follows:  start-date: fill in the first day of blog posting  end-date: fill in today (this is a parameter supported by GA Report, which means that it will always end according to the current query date)  metrics: select ga:pageviews  dimensions: select ga:pagePathIn order to reduce the returned results and reduce the network bandwidth, we add custom filtering rules 1:      filters: fill in ga:pagePath=~^/posts/.*/$;ga:pagePath!@=.    Among them, ; means using logical AND to concatenate two rules.    If the site.baseurl is specified, change the first filtering rule to ga:pagePath=~^/BASE_URL/posts/.*/$, where BASE_URL is the value of site.baseurl.  After Run Query, copy the generated contents of API Query URI at the bottom of the page and fill in the Encoded URI for the query of SuperProxy on GAE.After the query is saved on GAE, a Public Endpoint (public access address) will be generated, and we will get the query result in JSON format when accessing it. Finally, click Enable Endpoint in Public Request Endpoint to make the query effective, and click Start Scheduling in Scheduling to start the scheduled task.Configure Chirpy to Display Page ViewOnce all the hard part is done, it is very easy to enable the Page View on Chirpy theme. Your superProxy dashboard should look something like below and you can grab the required values.Update the _config.yml file of Chirpy project with the values from your dashboard, to look similar to the following:google_analytics:  id: &#39;G-V6XXXXXXX&#39;   # fill in your Google Analytics ID  pv:    proxy_endpoint: &#39;https://PROJECT_ID.REGION_ID.r.appspot.com/query?id=&amp;lt;ID FROM SUPER PROXY&amp;gt;&#39;    cache_path:       # the local PV cache data, friendly to visitors from GFW regionNow, you should see the Page View enabled on your blog.Reference            Google Analytics Core Reporting API: Filters &amp;#8617;      "

    "snippet": "PrerequisitesFollow the instructions in the Jekyll Docs to complete the installation of Ruby, RubyGems, Jekyll, and Bundler.InstallationCreating a New SiteThere are two ways to create a new repository for this theme:  Using the Chirpy Starter - Easy to upgrade, isolates irrelevant project files so you can focus on writing.  Forking on GitHub - Convenient for custom development, but difficult to upgrade. Unless you are familiar with Jekyll and are determined to tweak or contribute to this project, this approach is not recommended.Option 1. Using the Chirpy StarterCreate a new repository from the Chirpy Starter and name it &amp;lt;GH_USERNAME&amp;gt;.github.io, where GH_USERNAME represents your GitHub username.Option 2. Forking on GitHubFork Chirpy on GitHub and rename it to &amp;lt;GH_USERNAME&amp;gt;.github.io. Please note that the default branch code is in development.  If you want the site to be stable, please switch to the latest tag and start writing.And then execute:$ bash tools/init.sh  Note: If you don’t want to deploy your site on GitHub Pages, append option --no-gh at the end of the above command.The above command will:      Removes some files or directories from your repository:          .travis.yml      files under _posts      folder docs            If the option --no-gh is provided, the directory .github will be deleted. Otherwise, set up the GitHub Action workflow by removing the extension .hook of .github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml.hook, and then remove the other files and directories in the folder .github.        Removes item Gemfile.lock from .gitignore.        Creates a new commit to save the changes automatically.  Installing DependenciesBefore running for the first time, go to the root directory of your site, and install dependencies as follows:$ bundleUsageConfigurationUpdate the variables of _config.yml as needed. Some of them are typical options:  url  avatar  timezone  langCustoming StylesheetIf you need to customize the stylesheet, copy the theme’s assets/css/style.scss to the same path on your Jekyll site, and then add the custom style at the end of the style file.Starting from v4.1.0, if you want to overwrite the SASS variables defined in _sass/addon/variables.scss, create a new file _sass/variables-hook.scss and assign new values to the target variable in it.Running Local ServerYou may want to preview the site contents before publishing, so just run it by:$ bundle exec jekyll sOr run the site on Docker with the following command:$ docker run -it --rm \\    --volume=&quot;$PWD:/srv/jekyll&quot; \\    -p 4000:4000 jekyll/jekyll \\    jekyll serveAfter a while, the local service will be published at http://127.0.0.1:4000.DeploymentBefore the deployment begins, check out the file _config.yml and make sure the url is configured correctly. Furthermore, if you prefer the project site and don’t use a custom domain, or you want to visit your website with a base URL on a web server other than GitHub Pages, remember to change the baseurl to your project name that starts with a slash, e.g, /project-name.Now you can choose ONE of the following methods to deploy your Jekyll site.Deploy by Using Github ActionsFor security reasons, GitHub Pages build runs on safe mode, which restricts us from using plugins to generate additional page files. Therefore, we can use GitHub Actions to build the site, store the built site files on a new branch, and use that branch as the source of the GitHub Pages service.Quickly check the files needed for GitHub Actions build:      Ensure your Jekyll site has the file .github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml. Otherwise, create a new one and fill in the contents of the sample file, and the value of the on.push.branches should be the same as your repo’s default branch name.        Ensure your Jekyll site has file tools/deploy.sh. Otherwise, copy it from here to your Jekyll site.        Furthermore, if you have committed Gemfile.lock to the repo, and your runtime system is not Linux, don’t forget to update the platform list in the lock file:    $ bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux      After the above steps, rename your repository to &amp;lt;GH_USERNAME&amp;gt;.github.io on GitHub.Now publish your Jekyll site by:      Push any commit to remote to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow. Once the build is complete and successful, a new remote branch named gh-pages will appear to store the built site files.        Browse to your repository on GitHub. Select the tab Settings, then click Pages in the left navigation bar, and then in the section Source of GitHub Pages, select the /(root) directory of branch gh-pages as the publishing source. Remember to click Save before leaving.          Visit your website at the address indicated by GitHub.  Manually Build and DeployOn self-hosted servers, you cannot enjoy the convenience of GitHub Actions. Therefore, you should build the site on your local machine and then upload the site files to the server.Go to the root of the source project, and build your site as follows:$ JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll bOr build the site on Docker:$ docker run -it --rm \\    --env JEKYLL_ENV=production \\    --volume=&quot;$PWD:/srv/jekyll&quot; \\    jekyll/jekyll \\    jekyll buildUnless you specified the output path, the generated site files will be placed in folder _site of the project’s root directory. Now you should upload those files to the target server.UpgradingIt depends on how you use the theme:      If you are using the theme gem (there will be gem &quot;jekyll-theme-chirpy&quot; in the Gemfile), editing the Gemfile and update the version number of the theme gem, for example:    - gem &quot;jekyll-theme-chirpy&quot;, &quot;~&amp;gt; 3.2&quot;, &quot;&amp;gt;= 3.2.1&quot;+ gem &quot;jekyll-theme-chirpy&quot;, &quot;~&amp;gt; 3.3&quot;, &quot;&amp;gt;= 3.3.0&quot;        And then execute the following command:    $ bundle update jekyll-theme-chirpy        As the version upgrades, the critical files (for details, see the Startup Template) and configuration options will change. Please refer to the Upgrade Guide to keep your repo’s files in sync with the latest version of the theme.        If you forked from the source project (there will be gemspec in the Gemfile of your site), then merge the latest upstream tags into your Jekyll site to complete the upgrade.The merge is likely to conflict with your local modifications. Please be patient and careful to resolve these conflicts.  "

For instance:categories: [Animal, Insect]tags: [bee]Table of ContentsBy default, the Table of Contents (TOC) is displayed on the right panel of the post. If you want to turn it off globally, go to _config.yml and set the value of variable toc to false. If you want to turn off TOC for a specific post, add the following to the post’s Front Matter:---toc: false---CommentsSimilar to TOC, the Disqus comments are loaded by default in each post, and the global switch is defined by variable comments in file _config.yml .
